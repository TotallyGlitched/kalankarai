                                While new schools embraced the said programme, there were also consistent departures.

                                There was also lack of commitment from teachers to enhancing their skills. Wasn't sure
                                if schools will resist the new assessment model they were planning to introduce.

                                After an extensive study, we crafted eight (8) comprehensive personas for 4 different

                                of each group.

                        We collected all the data over a google sheet, from different locations. All of us pooled our
                        findings, intentionally steering clear of categorization to prevent any personal biases and kept
                        it completely open. After our field work, we gatehred together, and had lively and constructive
                        debates, all leading to a fascinating affinity mapping session.
                        <br><br>
                        The analysis phase was quite the marathon, spanning over a week, but it ultimately resulted in
                        the creation of comprehensive personas and ecosystems that had solutions for every question on
                        the client's mind.
                        <br><br>
                        Some of the findings were nothing short of remarkable, and wouldn’t refrain from claiming that
                        those wouldn't have happened without our deep-dive research.

                    As always, our journey was packed with valuable lessons. One significant challenge that stood out was the language barrier, given that our study spanned various languages and cultures. It became evident that language proficiency alone doesn't equate to a deep understanding of culture, traditions, values, and beliefs. While it's not always straightforward, we recognized the importance of involving researchers from the same or similar cultural background or having a cultural companion, as it could have made a substantial difference.
